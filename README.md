"It should not be difficult because all one needs is a consistent ethic of life, which emerges from wanting life to continue. This ethic is so obvious and basic that we might expect it to occur on any life bearing planet in the universe, once a species became self-aware enough of the arc of their history. So here's a draft life ethic and maybe a necessity. Life existing is preferable to no life existing. More kinds of life existing is preferable to fewer. Vibrant, complex ecosystems are preferable to small, fragmented, brittle ecosystems. Ecosystems with large complex life, like elephants and whales and humans are preferable to ecosystems with only microscopic life. Ecosystem supporting conscious minds, the virtual worlds in human minds, or a gorillas or crows or dolphins, are preferable to ecosystems without them. It is preferable to maximize existence, happiness, love, and understanding and minimize the suffering of minds in the universe. The future both near and far is real, in the same sense that now is real and via causality, is determined by what is done now. Things which are preferable by this definition may be considered good, things which are less preferable may be considered evil. We should maximize good and minimize evil, since the universe does not.
